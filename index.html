    <h1> GPA and the Joyous Pursuit of a 4.0 </h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p>GPA, the elusive numerical beast haunting every student's academic journey, is akin to chasing a mythical creature through a labyrinth of textbooks and late-night study sessions. Achieving a perfect 4.0 GPA seems as plausible as finding a unicorn in a crowded city park â€“ a quest filled with unexpected challenges, occasional setbacks, and a fair share of comedic mishaps. It's a journey where coffee becomes your trusted steed, and sleep, a long-forgotten friend. Each missed point on an exam feels like a dramatic plot twist in a sitcom, and every close call with a less-than-stellar grade becomes a subplot in the epic saga of academic conquests. Yet, amidst the chaos and laughter, the pursuit of that flawless GPA persists, an adventure filled with both triumphs and tales to share over a pizza-fueled study break.</p>
